## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

- [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

### What I learned

This one was a great fun to do! it gave me a good understanding on how to approach an api integration, while i still have a lot to learn about how to write a cleaner code, it is still a great intruduction to the subject.
I've put a lot more emphasis on creating an initial layout which helped my immensley with setting up the components.

### Continued development

I've realized during this project that i need to create more components, because i worked with components that were just to large to maintain.
Also i need to create a lot more hooks, there were many instances that i needed to manipulate or get data which could be more elegant with a hook.
The road is long but i'm having a blast!

### Useful resources

- [Github API Docs](https://docs.github.com/) - When integrating with Github API the documentation is very useful.
